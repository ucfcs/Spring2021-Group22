# Group 22 Minecraft Collaboration Research Project

## /CollectedData
This folder stores all of the data from the 6 groups that were run through the map.
The data is split by team, and there is one file that contains data for all the teams.

## /Epilog
[MuteCommentator]
This is our fork of Epilog. It contains new events, new event attributes, some experimenter tools,
some rewrites to fit our project, and a potential bug fix.

## /Marker
A utility plugin we used to mark where barrels and trophies were.

## /MazeEscape
The custom datapack that we used to run most of the functionality of our map. Near
the end of development we did introduce WorldGuard to handle some things that
we were struggling to get to work through native scripts.

## /Server
The most recent version of the server directory that we ran on the AWS instance.

## /Website
The python scripts used to generate data for the website, along with the website
source code.
