        <h4 class="card-title">Game Timeline Overview</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Our team has 4 Minecraft accounts that will be circulated among the participating teams each consisting of 4 players. This way more people can particpate in the research without having to have a Minecraft account as a requirement.
            <br><br>Excluding the warmup and game preparation, the game session will last 1 hour. The beginning of the game is expected to be slow, with players figuring out initial roles and deciding on a plan of action. A player will probably start planting seeds, another will explore the home area, and another will venture out to get a feel for the maze. Although the players will be briefed on everything during the warmup, the game is still expected to be foreign until they start getting their hands dirty.
            <br><br>After a brief exploration, players will settle into a routine style of gameplay. Once nightfall hits, players will either group up and sleep or group up in the home area to avoid dangerous night mobs.
            <br><br>About halfway into the gameplay, the players should have reached a point where some or all of them can survive nights in the maze due to the power-ups collected from the home area. At this point, it may be advantageous to leave the center area and only return to stock up on other undiscovered resources.
            <br><br>Once the hour has passed, the players will be teleported back to the main starting area and will not be able to continue collecting the trophies. The overall team score will be based on the total trophies the team has collected.
            <!-- <br><br>There will not be any point where the game is “finished”. Once the hour has passed, the game will be over. The score of the team will be based on the number of treasures they collected. -->

        <h4 class="card-title">General Data Collection</h4>
        <p class="card-text">
          Some events are collected right when an action takes place. Events like this include 
          breaking blocks and attacking entities. Other events are polled by the second, including
          player locations and potion effects. Because of this, viewers should be aware that the charts
          and visualizations on this website are <i>approximations</i> and are not exact.
        </p>

        <h4 class="card-title">HeapCraft</h4>
        <p class="card-text">HeapCraft is a project designed and created as a multi-disciplinary project to measure, analyze, and improve collaboration and cooperation in Minecraft. This data from a virtual world could then be taken and applied to real life in certain scenarios.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="card-title">Epilog</h4>
        <p class="card-text">This is the main tool under HeapCraft, it is the primary way that data is collected. It intercepts, classifies, and logs all the player behavior events that happen on any server using it as a plugin. Epilog is the main part of the HeapCraft project and the basis for most of the work that we are going to be doing in our project.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="card-title">Mute Commentator</h4>
        <p class="card-text">
          Mute Commentator is the nickname we gave to our fork of Epilog. 
          This fork included a removal of an intermediate server, a bug fix, custom events,
          and a few experiment tools.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          In the original plugin, there was an intermediary server between the server and the database. 
          Because we were planning to migrate the plugin towards a non-sql structure and were logging
          data points straight to a local database, we decided to remove the middleman.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          The original author decided to push data annotation to a separate thread. This was done with 
          the intent of making the plugin as least-intensive to the
          tick speed as possible. However, the Bukkit api is not thread-safe (https://bukkit.fandom.com/wiki/Scheduler_Programming).
          It seems that at some point the author recognized this, since the LogEvent originally included a seemingly
          random copy of a block's material. The likely explanation for this property is that its value became 
          "undefined behavior" when it was accessed from a non-main thread. To mitigate this problem, our
          team moved the data annotation process back to the primary thread. We noticed no performance impact
          for our small experiment setups.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Instead of adding endless general-purpose properties to the different Minecraft events, we decided
          to add some custom events to reflect how our custom map ran. We also added properties to events
          that made sense for our map - such as annotating many events with the zone the player was in when
          they generated it.
