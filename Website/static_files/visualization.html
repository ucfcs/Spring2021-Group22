        <div id="chat_count_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Displays the total number of chat messages that were sent by 
          each player. In general, this chart should be relatively equal
          to the chat content chart, but it would be interesting to see
          otherwise.

        <div id="distance_from_center_by_player_time_series"></div><br>
        <p>
          For each player, displays the distance that the player was from the center
          of the map over time. Because the scale is in minutes and steps were recorded
          per second, the data points are for the averaged distance the player was from 
          the center over each minute.

          Each pie chart is for a significant "labor" event. The pie charts
          are divided by player, showing each player's contribution to the total
          number of the particular event recorded. This can be used to visually
          identify what players were predominantly performing what action. In 
          general, the events that correlate with zones - such as DuneBreakEvent -
          should align with the bar chart displaying the amount of time each player
          spent in each zone.
        </p>
        <div id="diversity_of_labor_by_player_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Each bar is for a significant "labor" event. The bars are segregated by
          player, showing each players percentage of a certain event total. This is 
          another way to look at the pie charts above, but with an emphasis on each 
          player's contribution to all 'labor' events, not just their contribution to
          each 'labor' event.
        </p>
        <div id="entity_damage_interactions_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Shows the damage recieved and dealt to mobs in the game. This is meant to track
          players fighting hostile mobs in the maze, but will also include damage done
          to passive mobs in the center.
        </p>
        <div id="location_spread_by_player_time_series"></div><br>
        <p>
          For each player, displays the average distance that the player was from each other
          player over time. Because the scale is in minutes and steps were recorded
          per second, the data points are for the averaged distance the player was from 
          each other player over each minute. 
        </p>
        <div id="location_spread_time_series"></div><br>
        <p>
          Displays the average distance between all members over time. This was calculated
          by considering the average distance recorded for each player of each other player
          each minute. Each player's average minute-distance was added and divided by the size
          of the team (4). The calculation was done this way, instead of averaging each players
          distance from each other together, to take advantage of the way event collection was 
          occuring.
        </p>
        <div id="percent_duplicate_location_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Displays the number of locations players travelled that were already
          taken by themselves or any member of their team. Standing in place would
          only accumulate a single "new location". The total number of "duplicate" 
          locations were divided by the total number of locations recorded for the
          whole team.
        </p>
        <div id="sharing_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          A representation of the sharing of items. For each player, there are 2 bars: one
          for the number of items a player gave to another player, and one for the number
          of items a player recieved from another player. We hypothesized that large bars
          would signify collaborative efforts.
        </p>
        <div id="special_items_over_time_unweighted_time_series"></div><br>
        <p>
          A representation of the usage of powerups over time. For each second
          where a player was "using" a powerup, an event was recorded and is shown
          here. If a player attacked a mob, an event was logged. If a player used
          an "escape rope" to teleport to the center of the map, an event was logged.
          If a player was wearing a helmet in any given second, an event was logged.
          The reason powerups were tracked like this was to try to remain consistent
          across one-time powerups (escape rope), repeated-time powerups (sword, bow), 
          and continuous powerups (potions, glow path).
        </p>
        <div id="special_items_over_time_weighted_time_series"></div><br>
         <p>
          A representation of the usage of powerups over time. However, in contrast
          to the previous chart, this chart attempted to normalize powerups by their
          frequency (one-time, repeated-time, continuous). It is difficult to tell
          how effective this normalization was. With more time this chart could have 
          been tweaked better.
        </p>
        <div id="time_of_player_by_location_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Displays the total number of seconds that were spent by each player in each zone. This
          is useful in determining if players were completely specializing in zones or sharing
          responsibilities.
        </p>
        <div id="time_of_player_by_location_pie_charts" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr">
          <div id="time_of_player_by_location_pie_charts_1"></div>

          <div id="time_of_player_by_location_pie_charts_4"></div>
        </div><br>
        <p>
          Shows how each player distributed their time by zone. This should also be useful in determining
          if players were specializing in zones or not.
        </p>
        <div id="total_distance_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Shows the approximate total distance in meters travelled by each player.
        </p>
        <div id="trophy_count_column_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Shows the total trophies that were collected by each player. To any viewer who participated
          in the experiment, no, this is not a reflection of how well you did compared to your teammates.
          Completing the map was a team effort ;).
        </p>
        <div id="zone_timeline_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Shows what zone each player was in at any given second in the map. Something interesting to pull
          from this chart is how often and when each player spent time in the Maze.
        </p>
        <div id="death_timeline_step_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Shows the cumulative number of deaths for each minute of the map.
        </p>
        <div id="trophy_timeline_step_chart"></div><br>
        <p>
          Shows the cumulative number of trophies earned each minute of the map.
