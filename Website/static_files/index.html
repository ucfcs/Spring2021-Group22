        <h4 class="card-title">Abstract</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Research into collaborative artificial intelligence is showing promise. Minecraft, an open world sandbox game, is being used as a medium to explore advances in collaborative intelligence. A Minecraft virtual world will be built where players will collaborate to collect resources and discover trophies in a maze. After IRB confirmation, subjects will be recruited for the experiment from the internet and/or the university for participation. HeapCraft is an extension to the game that collects and visualizes data. The HeapCraft toolset will be extended and tailored so that we may collect data for collaborative AI analysis. Analysis will be performed on the collected data.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="card-title">What is Minecraft?</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Minecraft is a sandbox game that was started in 2009 in by Markus “Notch” Persson. It is a voxel (3d point) game written in the Java programming language. It is stylized in a cubic style with low resolution textures on each face of the blocks.
          Minecraft is such an expansive game because due to its sandbox nature, there are nearly infinite ways to play. The standard way to play is in a mode call survival, which drops you a randomly generated map. The map consists of multiple different biomes that the player can explore and harvest resources from. The beginning moments of the game usually involve finding a tree to punch to gather wood. After the player gathers a few logs by punching, they can craft the wood into some basic tools that will allow them to gather better resources. With these better tools, better resources and tools can be gathered.

          <br><br>
          Players can then explore the vast almost infinite world, encountering many different animals, monsters, villages, biomes, dimensions, and more. The map has many different biomes, mirroring real life biomes, such as deserts, forests, taigas, oceans, savannas, mountains, jungles, and more. Each biome has a different look and different blocks and trees. Structures generate around the map that give players something to look for as they walk around the world. Villages, hidden jungle temples, booby trapped desert pyramids, shipwrecks, igloos, and the stronghold, the portal to “the end”.
          <br><br>
          Resource gathering is the first main action, the other main action is building. Players can use the resources they gather to build any structure they want. Structures can serve a purpose such as a farm, be entirely for looks like a large statue, or any combination of the two like a castle with a farm. Minecraft provides many different blocks that can all be gathered and crafted together to provide players with as many tools a possible to allow them to build whatever they want. On top of just blocks, there are also animals, usually called mobs, that can be breed and killed for food and resources, plants that grow and can be harvested, saplings that grow into trees, beds that can be used to sleep through the night, boats, chests that can hold items, minecarts and minecart rails that can be used to move around, and so many other tools at a player’s disposal.

        <h4 class="card-title">Broader Impacts</h4>
        <p class="card-text">The impact of this project will be observed in related virtual world social experiments. Our methodologies for collecting data and the collected data itself can be referenced for other studies, just as we will be building upon the results published before us. For example, our plan for metric design will be influenced by the conclusions drawn from previous HeapCraft research. The master’s thesis by Stephan Muller identified that collaborating players tend to stay within 10 blocks of each other. Knowing this, we can design metrics that more accurately identify location patterns.
          <br><br>If we decide to extend the HeapCraft platform, then other groups using it in the future will benefit from the wider array of metrics. If we decide to build our own toolchain, it will be publicly available and share similar benefits. In any case, the analysis of the data collected will be useful for related studies. The success of the use of Minecraft as a virtual world medium will also be useful for inspiring future studies or directing them to other virtual world platforms.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Project Goals</h4>
        <p class="card-text">
          <ul>
            <li>Create a set of modules for measuring and visualizing player collaboration in Minecraft</li>
            <li>Design and develop a custom Minecraft map that motivates player collaboration</li>
            <li>Generate data and release as open source from the particpating teams</li>
            <li>Create a website to display the data visualizations in a user-friendly way</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="card-title">Implementation</h4>

        <p class="card-text">Many players would be on one server that is exchanging data with its own internal database and multiple plugins would interact with the server augmenting how the server operates. HeapCraft, or any other plugins we make, would use that fact to write any data it collects into a separate database with just the information we want on player interactions. We can then separately analyze the data to produce our results. This is how our team has analyzed the project requirements and aims to implement the research.</p>
